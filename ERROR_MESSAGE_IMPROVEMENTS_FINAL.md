# ✅ Error Message Improvements - Final Version!

## 🎯 Changes Made:

### 1. **Clarified It's User-Specific** ✅

**Old Message (Blamed the platform):**
```
"We've hit our daily limit for sending authentication codes (trial account)."
```

**New Message (User-specific):**
```
"Looks like you've hit your limit for authentication code requests today."
```

**What Changed:**
- ✅ Removed "trial account" mention
- ✅ Changed from "We've hit" to "You've hit"
- ✅ Clarifies it's tied to their phone number
- ✅ Not blaming the platform/product

---

### 2. **Better Button Text** ✅

**Old:**
```
"Got it, let me fix that!"
```

**New:**
```
"Sounds good, I'll try later"
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ More casual and friendly
- ✅ Acknowledges they understand
- ✅ Sets expectation they'll try later
- ✅ Not implying they need to "fix" something

---

### 3. **More Interesting Icon** ✅

**Old:**
```
<Timer size={24} color={Colors.purple} variant="Bold" />
```
(Hourglass/sandglass timer)

**New:**
```
<InfoCircle size={24} color={Colors.purple} variant="Bold" />
```
(Wondering/info icon - more interesting)

**Why Better:**
- ✅ More visually interesting
- ✅ Conveys "information" rather than just "time"
- ✅ Friendly and approachable
- ✅ Not as boring as hourglass
