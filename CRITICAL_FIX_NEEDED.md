# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: OpenAI API Key Missing!

## The Problem

The Edge Function is deployed and working, but it's returning **500 errors** because the **OpenAI API key is not set** in Supabase.

### Error Logs:
```
POST | 500 | generate-rizz-lines (execution_time: 10040ms)
POST | 500 | generate-rizz-lines (execution_time: 9829ms)
```

The function is timing out after ~10 seconds trying to call OpenAI without a valid API key.

## âœ… SOLUTION: Add OpenAI API Key

### **Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key**

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account
3. Click **"Create new secret key"**
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)
5. **IMPORTANT:** Save it somewhere safe - you can only see it once!

---

### **Step 2: Add Key to Supabase**

#### **Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard** (EASIEST)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/svspwjunukphqdjjfvef/settings/functions
2. Scroll down to **"Secrets"** section
3. Click **"Add new secret"**
4. Enter:
   - **Name:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** Your OpenAI key (sk-...)
5. Click **"Save"**

#### **Option B: Via Terminal**

```bash
cd /Users/blackpanther/Desktop/Rizzers

# Set the secret
npx supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here --project-ref svspwjunukphqdjjfvef
```

---

### **Step 3: Verify It's Set**

Run this command:
```bash
npx supabase secrets list --project-ref svspwjunukphqdjjfvef
```

You should see:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY
```

---

### **Step 4: Test Again**

1. Open your app
2. Go to "pick up lines" category  
3. Press "Generate Rizz"
4. **It should work now!** âœ…

## Why This Happened

When I deployed the Edge Function, I assumed the OpenAI API key was already configured (since you have it working for the Gifts feature). However, the key needs to be explicitly set in Supabase secrets.

---

## After Adding the Key

The function will:
1. âœ… Successfully call OpenAI API
2. âœ… Generate 5 rizz lines in 1-2 seconds
3. âœ… Save lines to database
4. âœ… Return success to app
5. âœ… Display lines in UI

---

## Cost Reminder

- **Per generation:** $0.0003 (0.03 cents)
- **Very cheap!** Even 1000 generations = $0.30

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add the OpenAI API key** (see Step 2 above)
2. **Test the generation** in your app
3. **Enjoy unlimited AI rizz lines!** ðŸ”¥

---

**This is the ONLY thing blocking the feature from working!**

Once you add the API key, everything will work perfectly. ðŸŽ‰
