# 🎉 App Loading Issue - FIXED!

## 🔴 **The Problem**

After IDE restart, the app was showing:
1. "Welcome to Expo" screen (routing issue)
2. Blank screen after splash (missing screen registrations)

---

## 🔍 **Root Causes Found**

### **Issue #1: Wrong Port**
- App was configured for port **9090**
- We were starting on port **9091** (wrong!)
- **Fix:** Started on correct port 9090

### **Issue #2: Simplified _layout.tsx**
- During debugging, I removed all providers
- Missing `phone-entry` and `phone-otp` screen registrations
- This caused blank screen after splash
- **Fix:** Restored full _layout.tsx with all providers

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Port Configuration**
```bash
# Started on correct port
npm start  # Uses port 9090 from package.json
```

### **2. _layout.tsx Restored**
**Added back:**
- ✅ ErrorBoundary (error handling)
- ✅ ToastProvider (notifications)
- ✅ AuthProvider (authentication state)
- ✅ `phone-entry` screen registration
- ✅ `phone-otp` screen registration

**Full screen list:**
- index (splash)
- splash
- landing (with video)
- phone-entry (NEW - signup flow)
- phone-otp (NEW - OTP verification)
- auth (auth folder)
- onboarding (onboarding folder)
- tabs (main app)
