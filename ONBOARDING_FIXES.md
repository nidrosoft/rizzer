# Onboarding Flow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Failed to Save Progress** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** "Failed to save progress" error during onboarding
**Root Cause:** Database policy issue (same 42P17 error from before)
**Status:** Already fixed by previous database policy migration
**Solution:** The UPDATE policy now works correctly after fixing the infinite recursion

### 2. **Location Modal Text** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** "Haha, you live in La Mesa! Great choice! We found some awesome matches nearby."
- Too dating-focused
- Not aligned with app's purpose

**Fixed To:**
```
"Perfect! You're in {city}! üéâ"
"We're already thinking about amazing date ideas and experiences in your area!"
```
- More exciting and curiosity-driven
- Focuses on date ideas and experiences
- Makes users smile

**File:** `app/onboarding/location.tsx`

### 3. **Location Tips Background** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Tips had same pink background as map area
**Fixed:** Changed to black/dark background with white text
- `backgroundColor: Colors.text` (black)
- Text color: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)`
- Icon color: `Colors.textWhite`
- Better contrast and visual separation

**File:** `app/onboarding/location.tsx`

### 4. **Map Display** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** Pink background instead of actual map
**Note:** This requires MapView component integration
**TODO:** 
- Install `react-native-maps` or `expo-maps`
- Replace pink background with actual map component
- Show user's location pin
- This is a larger feature that needs separate implementation

### 5. **Primary Goal Layout** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Options displayed in single column instead of 2x2 grid
**Fixed:**
- Added `justifyContent: 'space-between'` to grid
- Added `marginBottom` to cards
- Width already set to `48%` for 2-column layout
- Now displays properly as 2x2 grid

**File:** `app/onboarding/primaryGoal.tsx`

### 6. **Scrolling Issue** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Couldn't scroll to see continue button after selecting option
**Root Cause:** Content was in a `View` instead of `ScrollView`
**Fixed:**
- Changed `View` to `ScrollView` in OnboardingLayout
- Added `contentContainerStyle` for proper padding
- Added `showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}` for clean look
- Now all onboarding screens can scroll

**File:** `components/onboarding/OnboardingLayout.tsx`

## Auto-Save Implementation

The onboarding already has auto-save functionality:
- `useOnboardingStep` hook calls `saveProgress()` after each step
- Data is saved to Supabase `users` table
- `onboarding_step` field tracks progress
- User can resume from where they left off

**How it works:**
1. User enters data on a screen
2. Clicks continue button
3. `saveProgress()` is called automatically
4. Data saved to database with current step number
5. If user closes app and returns, they resume from saved step

## Testing Checklist
