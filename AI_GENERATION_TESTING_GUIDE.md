## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: "Failed to generate suggestions"**
**Possible causes:**
1. OpenAI API key not set in Supabase
2. Profile doesn't have enough data (need 30%+ quality)
3. Network error

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set
3. Check profile has interests, conversations, or notes
4. Check Edge Function logs:
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs generate-gift-suggestions --project-ref svspwjunukphqdjjfvef
   ```

### **Problem: Generation takes too long**
**Expected:** 2-5 seconds
**If longer:** Check OpenAI API status or network connection

### **Problem: No suggestions appear after generation**
**Solution:**
1. Check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM date_profile_ai_gift_suggestions 
   WHERE date_profile_id = 'YOUR_PROFILE_ID'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```
2. Check generation log:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM ai_gift_generation_log 
   WHERE date_profile_id = 'YOUR_PROFILE_ID'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

### **Problem: Button stays disabled**
**Solution:** 
- Close and reopen modal
- Check console for errors
- Verify `isGenerating` state resets

if (hoursSinceLastGen < 24) {
  showToast(`Next generation available in ${24 - hoursSinceLastGen} hours`, 'error');
  return;
}
```
