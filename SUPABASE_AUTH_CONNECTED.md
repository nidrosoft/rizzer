- ✅ Added loading state with spinner
- ✅ Real-time error handling with alerts
- ✅ Sends actual SMS via Twilio when user clicks Continue

**User Flow:**
1. User enters phone number
2. Clicks Continue button
3. **Real SMS sent via Twilio** 📲
4. Loading spinner shows while sending
5. Navigates to OTP screen on success
6. Shows error alert if SMS fails

---

### **2. OTP Verification Screen** (`/app/phone-otp.tsx`)
**Changes:**

- ✅ Verifies OTP with Supabase
- ✅ Creates user profile in database
- ✅ Checks onboarding status
- ✅ Routes to correct screen (onboarding vs home)
- ✅ Resend OTP functionality
- ✅ Loading states on both buttons

**User Flow:**
1. User enters 6-digit code from SMS
2. Clicks Continue button
3. **Code verified with Supabase** ✅
4. **User profile created/fetched from database**
5. Routes to:
   - `/onboarding-welcome` - New users (no name)
   - `/tabs` - Returning users (has name)
6. Shows error if code is invalid

---

## 🔐 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Phone Entry Flow:**
```typescript
// User enters: +1 234 567 8900
// Clicks Continue

1. sendOTP('+12345678900') called
2. Supabase → Twilio → SMS sent
3. User receives: "Your code is: 123456"
4. Navigate to OTP screen
```

### **OTP Verification Flow:**
```typescript
// User enters: 1 2 3 4 5 6
// Clicks Continue

1. login('+12345678900', '123456') called
2. Supabase verifies OTP
3. Check if user exists in database:
   - New user → Create profile with phone number
   - Existing user → Fetch profile data
4. Update auth store with user data
5. Route based on onboarding status:
   - No name → /onboarding-welcome (new user)
   - Has name → /tabs (returning user)
```

## 🔑 **WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DATABASE**

### **When User Signs Up:**
```sql
-- 1. Supabase Auth creates user
INSERT INTO auth.users (id, phone) 
VALUES ('uuid-here', '+12345678900');

-- 2. Your app creates profile
INSERT INTO users (id, phone) 
VALUES ('uuid-here', '+12345678900');
```

### **When User Logs In:**
```sql
-- 1. Fetch user profile
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 'uuid-here';

-- 2. Check onboarding status
-- If name IS NULL → New user → Onboarding
-- If name IS NOT NULL → Returning user → Home
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **SMS Not Received?**
1. Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
2. Verify Twilio credentials are correct
3. Check Twilio console for delivery status
4. Ensure phone number format is correct (+1234567890)

### **OTP Verification Fails?**
1. Check code is exactly 6 digits
2. Code expires after 60 seconds
3. Try resending code
4. Check Supabase logs for errors

### **User Not Created?**
1. Check Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → users
2. Verify RLS policies allow inserts
