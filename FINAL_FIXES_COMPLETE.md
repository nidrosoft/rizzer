# 🎉 All Issues Fixed - Final Update

## ✅ **Both Issues Resolved!**

### **Issue 1: Animated Loading States** ✅
**Request:** Make loading feel like a process with changing text

**Solution:** Added 5 animated loading steps that cycle every 800ms:
1. 🔍 Analyzing profile data...
2. 💭 Understanding preferences...
3. 🎯 Finding perfect matches...
4. 🎁 Curating gift ideas...
5. ✨ Almost there...

**File:** `/components/gifts-ideas/AIGiftSuggestionsModal.tsx`
- Added `useEffect` hook to cycle through loading steps
- Changes text every 800ms
- Gives user feeling of progress
- Shows the AI is working through a process

---

### **Issue 2: Database Constraint Error** ✅
**Error:** "null value in column 'expires_at' violates not-null constraint"

**Problem:** Missing `expires_at` field when inserting suggestions

**Solution:** Added `expires_at` field (24 hours from now)

**File:** `/supabase/functions/generate-gift-suggestions/index.ts`
- Line 377-378: Calculate expiration time (24 hours)
- Line 390: Add `expires_at` to insert
- Suggestions now properly expire after 24 hours

## 🎬 **What You'll See Now**
