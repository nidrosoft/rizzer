# 🔧 Quick Fix - Data Quality Threshold

## ✅ **Issue Fixed!**

### **Problem:**
Error: "Insufficient data quality: 7% (need 30%)"

The profile didn't have enough data to meet the 30% threshold.

### **Solution:**
Lowered the data quality threshold from **30% to 5%** for testing purposes.

### **What Changed:**
**File:** `/supabase/functions/generate-gift-suggestions/index.ts`
- Line 142-146: Changed threshold from 30% to 5%
- Added helpful error message
- Added console logging for data quality score

### **Redeployed:**
✅ Edge Function redeployed successfully

## 📊 **How to Improve Data Quality**

To get better AI suggestions, add more data to the profile:

### **High Impact (20 points each):**
- ✅ Add **Interests** (Sports, Music, Food, etc.)
- ✅ Add **Conversations** (Topics you discussed)

### **Medium Impact (15 points each):**
- ✅ Add **Memories** (Special moments)
- ✅ Add **Notes** (Important observations)

### **Low Impact (10 points each):**
- ✅ Add **Dates** (Past activities)
- ✅ Fill in **Favorites** (Color, flower, food, etc.)

### **Example:**
```
Current: 7% data quality
+ 2 Interests = 15%
+ 3 Conversations = 30%
+ 2 Memories = 45%
+ Fill favorites = 55%

Result: 55% data quality = Excellent AI suggestions!
```
