# 📱 **PHONE AUTHENTICATION ENHANCEMENTS**

## ✅ **TWILIO CAMPAIGN STATUS CONFIRMED**

Your Twilio screenshot shows:
- **A2P Campaign registration is in progress**
- Campaign is **under review** (may take several weeks)
- **You cannot send SMS until the campaign is approved**

**This is why you're getting the "Invalid From Number" error.** Your code is correct, but Twilio needs to approve your campaign first.
